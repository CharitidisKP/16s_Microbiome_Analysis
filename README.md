Repository for my thesis project regarding 16s microbiome analysis.
The repository contains the OTU table produced from the sequencing reads, metadata on the samples and biochemical data.
If you plan on using this code you need to change the paths in the chunks of code that load the data, as well as the paths for where the plots are saved.
